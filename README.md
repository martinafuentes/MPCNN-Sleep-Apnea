# MPCNN-Sleep-Apnea
We propose MPCNN, a novel feature extraction method for single-lead ECG analysis in apnea classification. Specifically, our approach is inspired by Matrix Profile (MP) algorithms, which utilize fixed-length subsequence distance profiles to capture critical features in the PQRST segment of an ECG signal. We extracted MinDP, MaxDP, and MeanDP values from these distance profiles to serve as inputs for CNN models. We compared this new feature extraction approach with conventional methods, such as R-peaks and RR intervals, in various experiments. Our results demonstrate that our technique has significant potential and efficacy for SA classification, delivering promising per-segment and per-recording performance metrics.
